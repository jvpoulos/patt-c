\begin{document}
\begin{newlfm}

I am writing to submit our manuscript entitled, ``Estimating population average treatment effects from experiments with noncompliance" for consideration for publication as a research article in \textit{JCI}. 

The manuscript extends a method of estimating population average treatment effects from RCTs in settings with noncompliance. It has been submitted solely to this journal and is not published, in press, or submitted elsewhere.

Thank you for receiving the manuscript and considering it for review.
