Figure on who is more likely to be compliers (using model predictions)

heterogeneous treatment effects with ensemble

Placebo tests - comparing the average outcomes predicted by the model with the average of the observed outcomes for the treated group. Again given sufficient power, a failure to find equivalence between the predicted and observed outcomes indicates a failure of at least one assumption underlying Theorem 1 and bias in the estimated population treatment effects.

*Comparision with previous results*

Who's a complier?
	The individuals who take up treatment are more likely to be female, on SNAP or TANF, and they have higher ER utilization in the pre-period. (K 30) (Table 3)

	Relative to our study population, compliers are somewhat older, more likely white, in worse health, and in 		lower socioeconomic status. (F 1078) (A26)

** Questions for Kellie **

relationship to reweighting methods
	The result enables us to estimate $\tau_{\text{PATT}}$ by reweighting the RCT responses according to the distribution of covariates in the population. (2.2)

	This shows that a reweighting approach is needed to extrapolate RCT results to a wider population. (4.2)
